There is also a counter at the bottom for keeping track of current number of runs.  Click on the number to increment the value, or click on the reset button to return it zero.

Your progress will be saved between sessions.  If you close your browser and return to the page at a different time, you will automatically navigate to your current place in the walkthrough.
